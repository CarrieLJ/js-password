# JavaScript Password Generator

## Desctiption
This password generator provides a random password by answering the prompted questions. This project is to build my skills with javascript. I learned that I don't quite have the skills to execute this correctly, yet.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Click on the "Generate Password" button. In the first prompt, answer how many characters you would like in your password (as long as it is between 8 and 128). Click ok or cancel for the rest of the popups to your choosing. Once all is answered, a random password is generated with the options you selected.
